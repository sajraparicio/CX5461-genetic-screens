abstract = {A compound that inhibits the formation of a complex composed of the ubiquitin E2 enzyme Ubc13 and Uev1A was isolated from the marine sponge Leucetta aff. microrhaphis. The compound was identified as leucettamol A (1) by spectroscopic analysis. Its inhibition of Ubc13-Uev1A interaction was tested by the ELISA method, revealing an IC50 value of 50 $\mu$g/mL. The compound is the first inhibitor of Ubc13-Uev1A interaction, that is, that of the E2 activity of Ubc13. Such inhibitors are presumed to be leads for anti-cancer agents that upregulate activity of the tumor suppressor p53 protein. Interestingly, hydrogenation of 1 increased its inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 4 $\mu$g/mL, while its tetraacetate derivative was inactive, indicating that the hydroxy and/or amino groups of 1 are required for the inhibition. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13 plays pivotal roles in diverse biological processes. Recent studies have elucidated that UBC13, in concert with the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF8, propagates the DNA damage signal via a ubiquitylation-dependent signaling pathway. However, mechanistically how UBC13 mediates its role in promoting checkpoint protein assembly and its genetic requirement for E2 variants remain elusive. Here we provide evidence to support the idea that the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex RNF8-UBC13 functions independently of E2 variants and is sufficient in facilitating ubiquitin conjugations and accumulation of DNA damage mediator 53BP1 at DNA breaks. The RNF8 RING domain serves as the molecular platform to anchor UBC13 at the damaged chromatin, where localized ubiquitylation events allow sustained accumulation of checkpoint proteins. Intriguingly, we found that only a group of RING domains derived from E3 ubiquitin ligases, which have been shown to interact with UBC13, enabled UBC13-mediated FK2 and 53BP1 focus formation at DNA breaks. We propose that the RNF8 RING domain selects and loads a subset of UBC13 molecules, distinct from those that exist as heterodimers, onto sites of double-strand breaks, which facilitates the amplification of DNA damage signals.},

abstract = {RNA G-quadruplexes located within the 5′-UTR of mRNA are almost always known to be associated with repression of cap-dependent translation. However, in this report we present functional as well as structural evidence that sequence redundancy in a G-rich segment within the 5′-UTR of human VEGF mRNA supports a ‘switchable' RNA G-quadruplex structure that is essential for IRES-mediated translation initiation. Additionally, utilization of a specific combination of G-tracts within this segment allows for the conformational switch that implies a tunable regulatory role of the quadruplex structure in translation initiation. A sequence engineered from a functionally handicapped mutant moderately rescued the activity, further indicating the importance of G-quadruplex structure for VEGF IRES-A function. This to our knowledge is the first report of a conformationally flexible RNA G-quadruplex which is essential for IRES-mediated translation initiation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Guanine-rich nucleic acid sequences are capable of folding into an intramolecular four-stranded structure called a G-quadruplex. When found in gene promoter regions, G-quadruplexes can downregulate gene expression, possibly by blocking the transcriptional machinery. Here we have used a genome-wide bioinformatic approach to identify Putative G-Quadruplex Sequences (PQS) in the Plasmodium falciparum genome, along with biophysical techniques to examine the physiological stability of P. falciparum PQS in vitro. RESULTS We identified 63 PQS in the non-telomeric regions of the P. falciparum clone 3D7. Interestingly, 16 of these PQS occurred in the upstream region of a subset of the P. falciparum var genes (group B var genes). The var gene family encodes PfEMP1, the parasite's major variant antigen and adhesin expressed at the surface of infected erythrocytes, that plays a key role in malaria pathogenesis and immune evasion. The ability of the PQS found in the upstream regions of group B var genes (UpsB-Q) to form stable G-quadruplex structures in vitro was confirmed using 1H NMR, circular dichroism, UV spectroscopy, and thermal denaturation experiments. Moreover, the synthetic compound BOQ1 that shows a higher affinity for DNA forming quadruplex rather than duplex structures was found to bind with high affinity to the UpsB-Q. CONCLUSION This is the first demonstration of non-telomeric PQS in the genome of P. falciparum that form stable G-quadruplexes under physiological conditions in vitro. These results allow the generation of a novel hypothesis that the G-quadruplex sequences in the upstream regions of var genes have the potential to play a role in the transcriptional control of this major virulence-associated multi-gene family.},

abstract = {Homologous recombination (HR) is a key pathway that repairs DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and helps to restart stalled or collapsed replication forks. How HR supports replication upon genotoxic stress is not understood. Using in vivo and in vitro approaches, we show that the MMS22L-TONSL heterodimer localizes to replication forks under unperturbed conditions and its recruitment is increased during replication stress in human cells. MMS22L-TONSL associates with replication protein A (RPA)-coated ssDNA, and the MMS22L subunit directly interacts with the strand exchange protein RAD51. MMS22L is required for proper RAD51 assembly at DNA damage sites in vivo, and HR-mediated repair of stalled forks is abrogated in cells expressing a MMS22L mutant deficient in RAD51 interaction. Similar to the recombination mediator BRCA2, recombinant MMS22L-TONSL limits the assembly of RAD51 on dsDNA, which stimulates RAD51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament formation and RAD51-dependent strand exchange activity in vitro Thus, by specifically regulating RAD51 activity at uncoupled replication forks, MMS22L-TONSL stabilizes perturbed replication forks by promoting replication fork reversal and stimulating their HR-mediated restart in vivo.},

abstract = {Despite the development of novel drugs, the prospects for many patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain dismal. This study reveals that the selective inhibitor of RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription, CX-5461, effectively treats aggressive AML, including mixed-lineage leukemia-driven AML, and outperforms standard chemotherapies. In addition to the previously characterized mechanism of action of CX-5461 (ie, the induction of p53-dependent apoptotic cell death), the inhibition of Pol I transcription also demonstrates potent efficacy in p53null AML in vivo. This significant survival advantage in both p53WT and p53null leukemic mice treated with CX-5461 is associated with activation of the checkpoint kinases 1/2, an aberrant G2/M cell-cycle progression and induction of myeloid differentiation of the leukemic blasts. The ability to target the leukemic-initiating cell population is thought to be essential for lasting therapeutic benefit. Most strikingly, the acute inhibition of Pol I transcription reduces both the leukemic granulocyte-macrophage progenitor and leukemia-initiating cell (LIC) populations, and suppresses their clonogenic capacity. This suggests that dysregulated Pol I transcription is essential for the maintenance of their leukemia-initiating potential. Together, these findings demonstrate the therapeutic utility of this new class of inhibitors to treat highly aggressive AML by targeting LICs.},

abstract = {The nuclease hypersensitivity element III(1) upstream of the P1 promoter of c-MYC controls 85-90{\%} of the transcriptional activation of this gene. We have demonstrated that the purine-rich strand of the DNA in this region can form two different intramolecular G-quadruplex structures, only one of which seems to be biologically relevant. This biologically relevant structure is the kinetically favored chair-form G-quadruplex, which is destabilized when mutated with a single G --{\textgreater} A transition, resulting in a 3-fold increase in basal transcriptional activity of the c-MYC promoter. The cationic porphyrin TMPyP4, which has been shown to stabilize this G-quadruplex structure, is able to suppress further c-MYC transcriptional activation. These results provide compelling evidence that a specific G-quadruplex structure formed in the c-MYC promoter region functions as a transcriptional repressor element. Furthermore, we establish the principle that c-MYC transcription can be controlled by ligand-mediated G-quadruplex stabilization.},

abstract = {The Y-family DNA polymerase Rev1 is required for successful replication of G-quadruplex DNA (G4 DNA) in higher eukaryotes. Here we show that human Rev1 (hRev1) disrupts G4 DNA structures and prevents refolding in vitro. Nucleotidyl transfer by hRev1 is not necessary for mechanical unfolding to occur. hRev1 binds G4 DNA substrates with Kd,DNA values that are 4-15-fold lower than those of non-G4 DNA substrates. The pre-steady-state rate constant of deoxycytidine monophosphate (dCMP) insertion opposite the first tetrad-guanine by hRev1 is ∼56{\%} as fast as that observed for non-G4 DNA substrates. Thus, hRev1 can promote fork progression by either dislodging tetrad guanines to unfold the G4 DNA, which could assist in extension by other DNA polymerases, or hRev1 can prevent refolding of G4 DNA structures. The hRev1 mechanism of action against G-quadruplexes helps explain why replication progress is impeded at G4 DNA sites in Rev1-deficient cells and illustrates another unique feature of this enzyme with important implications for genome maintenance.},

abstract = {BRCA1 functions at two distinct steps during homologous recombination (HR). Initially, it promotes DNA end resection, and subsequently it recruits the PALB2 and BRCA2 mediator complex, which stabilizes RAD51-DNA nucleoprotein filaments. Loss of 53BP1 rescues the HR defect in BRCA1-deficient cells by increasing resection, suggesting that BRCA1's downstream role in RAD51 loading is dispensable when 53BP1 is absent. Here we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF168, in addition to its canonical role in inhibiting end resection, acts in a redundant manner with BRCA1 to load PALB2 onto damaged DNA. Loss of RNF168 negates the synthetic rescue of BRCA1 deficiency by 53BP1 deletion, and it predisposes BRCA1 heterozygous mice to cancer. BRCA1+/-RNF168-/- cells lack RAD51 foci and are hypersensitive to PARP inhibitor, whereas forced targeting of PALB2 to DNA breaks in mutant cells circumvents BRCA1 haploinsufficiency. Inhibiting the chromatin ubiquitin pathway may, therefore, be a synthetic lethality strategy for BRCA1-deficient cancers.},

abstract = {BRCA1 and BRCA2 are prominently associated with inherited breast and ovarian cancer. The encoded proteins function in DNA damage responses, but no functional link between BRCA1 and BRCA2 has been established. We show here that PALB2 physically and functionally connects BRCA1 and BRCA2 into a DNA damage response network that also includes the RAD51 recombinase. PALB2 directly binds BRCA1, as determined with bacterially expressed fragments of each protein. Furthermore, PALB2 independently interacts with BRCA1 and BRCA2 through its NH2 and COOH termini, respectively. Critically, two point mutants (L21P and L24P) of the PALB2 coiled-coil domain or an NH2-terminal deletion ($\Delta$1-70) disrupt its interaction with BRCA1. We have reconstituted PALB2-deficient cells with PALB2$\Delta$1-70, PALB2-L21P, or PALB2-L24P, or with COOH-terminally truncated PALB2 that is deficient for interaction with BRCA2. Using extracts from these cells, we find that PALB2 mediates the physical interaction of BRCA2 with a COOH-terminal fragment of BRCA1. Analysis of the assembly of foci in these cells by BRCA1, PALB2, BRCA2, and RAD51 suggests that BRCA1 recruits PALB2, which in turn organizes BRCA2 and RAD51. Resistance to mitomycin C and the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination require the interaction of PALB2 with both BRCA1 and BRCA2. These results suggest that BRCA1 and BRCA2 cooperate in DNA damage responses in a PALB2-dependent manner, and have important implications for the genesis of breast/ovarian cancer and for chemotherapy with DNA interstrand cross-linking agents.

The MMS2-encoded UEV protein has been genetically implicated in error-free postreplicative DNA repair in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that Mms2p forms a specific heteromeric complex with the UBC13-encoded E2 and is required for the Ubc13p-dependent assembly of polyubiquitin chains linked through lysine 63. A ubc13 yeast strain is UV sensitive, and single, double, and triple mutants of the UBC13, MMS2, and ubiquitin (ubiK63R) genes display a comparable phenotype. These findings support a model in which an Mms2p/Ubc13p complex assembles novel polyubiquitin chains for signaling in DNA repair, and they suggest that UEV proteins may act to increase diversity and selectivity in ubiquitin conjugation.},

abstract = {DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) elicit a ubiquitylation cascade that controls DNA repair pathway choice. This cascade involves the ubiquitylation of histone H2A by the RNF168 ligase and the subsequent recruitment of RIF1, which suppresses homologous recombination (HR) in G1 cells. The RIF1-dependent suppression is relieved in S/G2 cells, allowing PALB2-driven HR to occur. With the inhibitory impact of RIF1 relieved, it remains unclear how RNF168-induced ubiquitylation influences HR. Here, we uncover that RNF168 links the HR machinery to H2A ubiquitylation in S/G2 cells. We show that PALB2 indirectly recognizes histone ubiquitylation by physically associating with ubiquitin-bound RNF168. This direct interaction is mediated by the newly identified PALB2-interacting domain (PID) in RNF168 and the WD40 domain in PALB2, and drives DNA repair by facilitating the assembly of PALB2-containing HR complexes at DSBs. Our findings demonstrate that RNF168 couples PALB2-dependent HR to H2A ubiquitylation to promote DNA repair and preserve genome integrity.},

We observed that the overall reactivity of the guanine residues within this tract toward DMS was significantly reduced compared with other guanine residues of the flanking regions in both in vitro and in vivo footprinting experiments. We also demonstrated that nucleolin, which is known to bind to G-quadruplex structures, is able to bind specifically to the G-rich sequence of this region in negatively supercoiled DNA.

abstract = {BLM and WRN are RecQ DNA helicasesessential for genomic stability. Here, we demonstrate that HERC2, a HECT E3 ligase, is critical for their functions to suppress G-quadruplex (G4) DNA. HERC2 interacted with BLM, WRN, and replication protein A (RPA) complexes during the S-phase of the cell cycle. Depletion of HERC2 dissociated RPA from BLM and WRN complexes and significantly increased G4 formation. Triple depletion revealed that HERC2 has an epistatic relationship with BLM and WRN in their G4-suppressing function. In vitro, HERC2 released RPA onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) rather than anchoring onto RPA-coated ssDNA. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of the catalytic ubiquitin-binding site of HERC2 inhibited ubiquitination of RPA2, caused RPA accumulation in the helicase complexes, and increased G4, indicating an essential role for E3 activity in the suppression of G4. Both depletion of HERC2 and inactivation of E3 sensitized cells to the G4-interacting compounds telomestatin and pyridostatin. Overall, these results indicate that HERC2 is a master regulator of G4 suppression that affects the sensitivity of cells to G4 stabilizers. Given that HERC2 expression is frequently reduced in many types of cancers, G4 accumulation as a result of HERC2 deficiency may provide a therapeutic target for G4 stabilizers.Significance: HERC2 is revealed as a master regulator of G-quadruplex, a DNA secondary structure that triggers genomic instability and may serve as a potential molecular target in cancer therapy.Graphical Abstract: http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/78/22/6371/F1.large.jpg Cancer Res; 78(22); 6371-85. {\textcopyright}2018 AACR.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND
Pyridoquinazolinecarboxamides have been reported as RNA polymerase I inhibitors and represent a novel class of potential antitumor agents. BMH-21, was reported to intercalate with GC-rich rDNA, resulting in nucleolar stress as a primary mechanism of cytotoxicity. 

METHODS
The interaction of BMH-21 and analogues with DNA G-quadruplex structures was studied by NMR and molecular modelling. The cellular response was investigated in a panel of human tumor cell lines and protein expression was examined by Western Blot analysis. 

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
We explored the ability of BMH-21 and its analogue 2 to bind to G-quadruplex present in the c-MYC promoter, by NMR and molecular modelling studies. We provide evidence that both compounds are not typical DNA intercalators but are effective binders of the tested G-quadruplex. The interaction with c-MYC G-quadruplex was reflected in down-regulation of c-Myc expression in human tumor cells. The inhibitory effect was almost complete in lymphoma cells SUDHL4 characterized by overexpression of c-Myc protein. This downregulation reflected an early and persistent modulation of cMyc mRNA. Given the relevance of c-MYC in regulation of ribosome biogenesis, it is conceivable that the inhibition of c-MYC contributes to the perturbation of nuclear functions and RNA polymerase I activity. Similar experiments with CX-5461, another RNA polymerase I transcription inhibitor, indicate the same behaviour in G-quadruplex stabilization. 

GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE
Our results support the hypothesis that BMH-21 and analogue compounds share the same mechanism, i.e. G-quadruplex binding as a primary event of a cascade leading to inhibition of RNA polymerase I and apoptosis.},

abstract = {DNA breaks are complex lesions that can be repaired either by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or by homologous recombination (HR). The decision between these two routes of DNA repair is a key point of the DNA damage response (DDR) that is controlled by DNA resection. The core machinery catalyzing the resection process is well established. However, little is known about the additional requirements of DNA resection over DNA structures with high complexity. Here, we found evidence that the human helicase PIF1 has a role in DNA resection, specifically for defined DNA regions, such as those prone to form G-quadruplexes. Indeed, PIF1 is recruited to the site of DNA damage and physically interacts with proteins involved in DNA resection, and its depletion causes DNA damage sensitivity and a reduction of HR efficiency. Moreover, G4 stabilization by itself hampers DNA resection, a phenomenon suppressed by PIF1 overexpression. DNA resection machinery is well established in eukaryotes. However, little is known of the accessory factors required to resect over atypical DNA structures. In this paper, Jimeno et al. show that the helicase PIF1 facilitates resection, particularly at complex sequences that tend to form G-quadruplexes.},

Neuroblastomas with a high mitosis-karyorrhexis index (High-MKI) are often associated with MYCN amplification, MYCN protein overexpression and adverse clinical outcome. However, the prognostic effect of MYC-family protein expression on these neuroblastomas is less understood, especially when MYCN is not amplified. To address this, MYCN and MYC protein expression in High-MKI cases (120 MYCN amplified and 121 non-MYCN amplified) was examined by immunohistochemistry. The majority (101) of MYCN-amplified High-MKI tumors were MYCN(+), leaving one MYC(+), 2 both(+), and 16 both(-)/(+/-), whereas non-MYCN-amplified cases appeared heterogeneous, including 7 MYCN(+), 36 MYC(+), 3 both(+), and 75 both(-)/(+/-) tumors. These MYC-family proteins(+), or MYC-family driven tumors, were most likely to have prominent nucleolar (PN) formation (indicative of augmented rRNA synthesis). High-MKI neuroblastoma patients showed a poor survival irrespective of MYCN amplification. However, patients with MYC-family driven High-MKI neuroblastomas had significantly lower survival than those with non-MYC-family driven tumors. MYCN(+), MYC-family protein(+), PN(+), and clinical stage independently predicted poor survival. Specific inhibition of hyperactive rRNA synthesis and protein translation was shown to be an effective way to suppress MYC/MYCN protein expression and neuroblastoma growth. Together, MYC-family protein overexpression and PN formation should be included in new neuroblastoma risk stratification and considered for potential therapeutic targets.},

abstract = {Ubiquitin-dependent signaling during the DNA damage response (DDR) to double-strand breaks (DSBs) is initiated by two E3 ligases, RNF8 and RNF168, targeting histone H2A and H2AX. RNF8 is the first ligase recruited to the damage site, and RNF168 follows RNF8-dependent ubiquitination. This suggests that RNF8 initiates H2A/H2AX ubiquitination with K63-linked ubiquitin chains and RNF168 extends them. Here, we show that RNF8 is inactive toward nucleosomal H2A, whereas RNF168 catalyzes the monoubiquitination of the histones specifically on K13-15. Structure-based mutagenesis of RNF8 and RNF168 RING domains shows that a charged residue determines whether nucleosomal proteins are recognized. We find that K63 ubiquitin chains are conjugated to RNF168-dependent H2A/H2AX monoubiquitination at K13-15 and not on K118-119. Using a mutant of RNF168 unable to target histones but still catalyzing ubiquitin chains at DSBs, we show that ubiquitin chains per se are insufficient for signaling, but RNF168 target ubiquitination is required for DDR.},

abstract = {DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) elicit a histone modification cascade that controls DNA repair. This pathway involves the sequential ubiquitination of histones H1 and H2A by the E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF8 and RNF168, respectively. RNF168 ubiquitinates H2A on lysine 13 and lysine 15 (refs 7, 8) (yielding H2AK13ub and H2AK15ub, respectively), an event that triggers the recruitment of 53BP1 (also known as TP53BP1) to chromatin flanking DSBs. 53BP1 binds specifically to H2AK15ub-containing nucleosomes through a peptide segment termed the ubiquitination-dependent recruitment motif (UDR), which requires the simultaneous engagement of histone H4 lysine 20 dimethylation (H4K20me2) by its tandem Tudor domain. How 53BP1 interacts with these two histone marks in the nucleosomal context, how it recognizes ubiquitin, and how it discriminates between H2AK13ub and H2AK15ub is unknown. Here we present the electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a dimerized human 53BP1 fragment bound to a H4K20me2-containing and H2AK15ub-containing nucleosome core particle (NCP-ubme) at 4.5 {\AA} resolution. The structure reveals that H4K20me2 and H2AK15ub recognition involves intimate contacts with multiple nucleosomal elements including the acidic patch. Ubiquitin recognition by 53BP1 is unusual and involves the sandwiching of the UDR segment between ubiquitin and the NCP surface. The selectivity for H2AK15ub is imparted by two arginine fingers in the H2A amino-terminal tail, which straddle the nucleosomal DNA and serve to position ubiquitin over the NCP-bound UDR segment. The structure of the complex between NCP-ubme and 53BP1 reveals the basis of 53BP1 recruitment to DSB sites and illuminates how combinations of histone marks and nucleosomal elements cooperate to produce highly specific chromatin responses, such as those elicited following chromosome breaks.},

We also show that depletion of the E2 enzyme UBC13 impairs 53BP1 recruitment to sites of damage, which suggests that it cooperates with RNF8. Finally, we reveal that RNF8 promotes the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint and resistance to ionizing radiation. These results demonstrate how the DNA-damage response is orchestrated by ATM-dependent phosphorylation of MDC1 and RNF8-mediated ubiquitination.},

abstract = {Hallmark deregulated signaling in cancer cells drives excessive ribosome biogenesis within the nucleolus, which elicits unbridled cell growth and proliferation. The rate-limiting step of ribosome biogenesis is synthesis of rRNA (building blocks of ribosomes) by RNA Polymerase I (Pol I). Numerous kinase pathways and products of proto-oncogenes can up-regulate Pol I, whereas tumor suppressor proteins can inhibit rRNA synthesis. In tumorigenesis, activating mutations in certain cancer-associated kinases and loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppressors lead to deregulated signaling that stimulates Pol I transcription with resultant increases in ribosome biogenesis, protein synthesis, cell growth, and proliferation. Certain anticancer therapeutics, such as cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil, reportedly exert, at least partially, their activity through disruption of ribosome biogenesis, yet many prime targets for anticancer drugs within the ribosome synthetic machinery of the nucleolus remain largely unexploited. Herein, we describe CX-3543, a small molecule nucleolus-targeting agent that selectively disrupts nucleolin/rDNA G-quadruplex complexes in the nucleolus, thereby inhibiting Pol I transcription and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. CX-3543 is the first G-quadruplex interactive agent to enter human clinical trials, and it is currently under evaluation against carcinoid/neuroendocrine tumors in a phase II clinical trial.},

In this study we tested if MYC-coordination of rRNA transcription in the nucleolus and in the mitochondrion drives (cancer) cell proliferation. Here we show that the anti-proliferative effect of CX-5461, a Pol I inhibitor of rRNA transcription, in ovarian (cancer) cell contexts characterized by MYC overexpression is enhanced either by 2{\&}rsquo;-C-Methyl Adenosine (2{\&}rsquo;-C-MeA), a ribonucleoside that inhibits POLRMT mitochondrial rRNA (mt-rRNA) transcription and doxycycline, a tetracycline known to affect mitochondrial translation. Thus, hindering not only mt-rRNA transcription, but also mitoribosome function in MYC-overexpressing ovarian (cancer) cells, potentiates the antiproliferative effect of CX-5461. Targeting MYC-regulated rRNA transcription and ribogenesis in both the nucleolus and mitochondrion seems to be a novel approach worth of consideration for treating MYC-driven cancer.},

abstract = {PURPOSE The MYC oncogene is frequently overexpressed in prostate cancer. Upregulation of ribosome biogenesis and function is characteristic of MYC-driven tumors. In addition, PIM kinases activate MYC signaling and mRNA translation in prostate cancer and cooperate with MYC to accelerate tumorigenesis. Here, we investigate the efficacy of a single and dual approach targeting ribosome biogenesis and function to treat prostate cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN The inhibition of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis with CX-5461, a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable inhibitor of RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription, has been successfully exploited therapeutically but only in models of hematologic malignancy. CX-5461 and CX-6258, a pan-PIM kinase inhibitor, were tested alone and in combination in prostate cancer cell lines, in Hi-MYC- and PTEN-deficient mouse models and in patient-derived xenografts (PDX) of metastatic tissue obtained from a patient with castration-resistant prostate cancer. RESULTS CX-5461 inhibited anchorage-independent growth and induced cell-cycle arrest in prostate cancer cell lines at nanomolar concentrations. Oral administration of 50 mg/kg CX-5461 induced TP53 expression and activity and reduced proliferation (MKI67) and invasion (loss of ductal actin) in Hi-MYC tumors, but not in PTEN-null (low MYC) tumors. While 100 mg/kg CX-6258 showed limited effect alone, its combination with CX-5461 further suppressed proliferation and dramatically reduced large invasive lesions in both models. This rational combination strategy significantly inhibited proliferation and induced cell death in PDX of prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate preclinical efficacy of targeting the ribosome at multiple levels and provide a new approach for the treatment of prostate cancer.

abstract = {A remarkable number of guanine-rich sequences with potential to adopt non-canonical secondary structures called G-quadruplexes (or G4 DNA) are found within gene promoters. Despite growing interest, regulatory role of quadruplex DNA motifs in intrinsic cellular function remains poorly understood. Herein, we asked whether occurrence of potential G4 (PG4) DNA in promoters is associated with specific function(s) in bacteria. Using a normalized promoter-PG4-content (PG4(P)) index we analysed {\textgreater}60,000 promoters in 19 well-annotated species for (a) function class(es) and (b) gene(s) with enriched PG4(P). Unexpectedly, PG4-associated functional classes were organism specific, suggesting that PG4 motifs may impart specific function to organisms. As a case study, we analysed radioresistance. Interestingly, unsupervised clustering using PG4(P) of 21 genes, crucial for radioresistance, grouped three radioresistant microorganisms including Deinococcus radiodurans. Based on these predictions we tested and found that in presence of nanomolar amounts of the intracellular quadruplex-binding ligand N-methyl mesoporphyrin (NMM), radioresistance of D. radiodurans was attenuated by {\~{}}60{\%}. In addition, important components of the RecF recombinational repair pathway recA, recF, recO, recR and recQ genes were found to harbour promoter-PG4 motifs and were also down-regulated in presence of NMM. Together these results provide first evidence that radioresistance may involve G4 DNA-mediated regulation and support the rationale that promoter-PG4s influence selective functions.},

The resulting adducts of both compounds exploit a binding groove unique to Ubc13. We developed a Ubc13 mutant which resists NSC697923 inhibition and, using this mutant, we show that the inhibition of cellular DNA damage and NF-$\kappa$B signaling by NSC697923 is largely due to specific Ubc13 inhibition. We propose that unique structural features near the Ubc13 active site could provide a basis for the rational development and design of specific Ubc13 inhibitors.},

In the yeast S. cerevisiae, we report that G-quadruplexes form and, if not properly processed, pose a specific challenge to replication. We show that the G-quadruplex-prone CEB1 tandem array is tolerated when inserted near ARS305 replication origin in wild-type cells but is very frequently destabilized upon treatment with the potent Phen-DC(3) G-quadruplex ligand, or in the absence of the G-quadruplex-unwinding Pif1 helicase, only when the G-rich strand is the template of leading-strand replication. The orientation-dependent instability is associated with the formation of Rad51-Rad52-dependent X-shaped intermediates during replication detected by two-dimensional (2D) gels, and relies on the presence of intact G-quadruplex motifs in CEB1 and on the activity of ARS305. The asymmetrical behaviour of G-quadruplex prone sequences during replication has implications for their evolutionary dynamics within genomes, including the maintenance of G-rich telomeres.},

abstract = {CX-5461 is currently in Phase I/II clinical trials for advanced hematologic malignancies and triple negative or BRCA-deficient breast cancer. The compound is currently administered to patients intravenously (i.v.) at low pH (3.5) due to solubility challenges. Reliance of low pH to enhance solubility of CX-5461 can adversely impact pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and therapeutic potential. We have addressed this solubility issue through a formulation method that relies on the interactions between CX-5461 and copper. Copper binds CX-5461 through the nitrogens of the pyrazine ring. Here, we describe synthesizing this copper-complexed CX-5461 (Cu(CX-5461)) within liposomes. CX-5461 was added to copper-containing liposomes and incubated at 60 °C for 30 min. The pharmacokinetics of CX-5461 was assessed in mice following a single i.v. injection at 30 mg/kg. Efficacy studies were completed in multiple subcutaneous mouse xenografts as well as in a bone marrow engraftment model of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The novel Cu(CX-5461) formulation was stable at pH 7.4 and exhibited increased plasma circulation longevity, increasing the total exposure to CX5461 by an order of magnitude. Cu(CX-5461) was more active than CX-5461 in AML models in vivo. In HCT116-B46 and Capan-1 solid tumour models that are BRCA-deficient, the Cu(CX-5461) formulation engendered activity that was comparable to that of the low pH CX-5461 formulation. We have generated the first Cu(CX-5461) formulation suitable for i.v. administration that is more efficacious than the existing low-pH formulation in pre-clinical models of AML. The Cu(CX-5461) formulation may serve as an alternative formulation for CX-5461 in BRCA-deficient cancers.},

In the present study we report that BAY 11-7082 does not inhibit the IKKs, but suppresses their activation in LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-stimulated RAW macrophages and IL (interleukin)-1-stimulated IL-1R (IL-1 receptor) HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells. BAY 11-7082 exerts these effects by inactivating the E2-conjugating enzymes Ubc (ubiquitin conjugating) 13 and UbcH7 and the E3 ligase LUBAC (linear ubiquitin assembly complex), thereby preventing the formation of Lys63-linked and linear polyubiquitin chains. BAY 11-7082 prevents ubiquitin conjugation to Ubc13 and UbcH7 by forming a covalent adduct with their reactive cysteine residues via Michael addition at the C3 atom of BAY 11-7082, followed by the release of 4-methylbenzene-sulfinic acid. BAY 11-7082 stimulated Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chain formation in cells and protected HIF1$\alpha$ (hypoxia-inducible factor 1$\alpha$) from proteasomal degradation, suggesting that it inhibits the proteasome.

Here, we show a strong correlation between high-risk disease, MYCN expression, poor survival, and ribosome biogenesis in neuroblastoma patients. Treatment of neuroblastoma cells with quarfloxin or CX-5461, two small molecule inhibitors of RNA polymerase I, suppressed MycN expression, induced DNA damage, and activated p53 followed by cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. CX-5461 repressed the growth of established MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma xenograft tumors in nude mice.

abstract = {53BP1 (also called TP53BP1) is a chromatin-associated factor that promotes immunoglobulin class switching and DNA double-strand-break (DSB) repair by non-homologous end joining. To accomplish its function in DNA repair, 53BP1 accumulates at DSB sites downstream of the RNF168 ubiquitin ligase. How ubiquitin recruits 53BP1 to break sites remains unknown as its relocalization involves recognition of histone H4 Lys 20 (H4K20) methylation by its Tudor domain. Here we elucidate how vertebrate 53BP1 is recruited to the chromatin that flanks DSB sites. We show that 53BP1 recognizes mononucleosomes containing dimethylated H4K20 (H4K20me2) and H2A ubiquitinated on Lys 15 (H2AK15ub), the latter being a product of RNF168 action on chromatin. 53BP1 binds to nucleosomes minimally as a dimer using its previously characterized methyl-lysine-binding Tudor domain and a carboxy-terminal extension, termed the ubiquitination-dependent recruitment (UDR) motif, which interacts with the epitope formed by H2AK15ub and its surrounding residues on the H2A tail. 53BP1 is therefore a bivalent histone modification reader that recognizes a histone 'code' produced by DSB signalling.},

Using an improved Bayesian analytical approach, we consistently discover 5-fold more fitness genes than were previously observed. We present a list of 1,580 human core fitness genes and describe their general properties. Moreover, we demonstrate that context-dependent fitness genes accurately recapitulate pathway-specific genetic vulnerabilities induced by known oncogenes and reveal cell-type-specific dependencies for specific receptor tyrosine kinases, even in oncogenic KRAS backgrounds. Thus, rigorous identification of human cell line fitness genes using a high-complexity CRISPR-Cas9 library affords a high-resolution view of the genetic vulnerabilities of a cell.},

abstract = {G-quadruplex (G4) is a DNA secondary structure that has been found to play regulatory roles in the genome. The identification of G4-forming sequences is important to study the specific structure-function relationships of such regions. In the present study, we developed a method for identification of G4 clusters on genomic DNA by high-throughput sequencing of genomic DNA amplified via whole-genome amplification (WGA) in the presence of a G4 ligand. The G4 ligand specifically bound to G4 structures on genomic DNA; thus, DNA polymerase was arrested on the G4 structures stabilised by G4 ligand. We utilised the telomestatin derivative L1H1-7OTD as a G4 ligand and demonstrated that the efficiency of amplification of the G4 cluster regions was lower than that of the non-G4-forming regions. By high-throughput sequencing of the WGA products, 9,651 G4 clusters were identified on human genomic DNA. Among these clusters, 3,766 G4 clusters contained at least one transcriptional start site, suggesting that genes are regulated by G4 clusters rather than by one G4 structure.},

abstract = {G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structures are extremely stable four-stranded secondary structures held together by noncanonical G-G base pairs. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to determine the in vivo binding sites of the multifunctional Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pif1 DNA helicase, a potent unwinder of G4 structures in vitro. G4 motifs were a significant subset of the high-confidence Pif1-binding sites. Replication slowed in the vicinity of these motifs, and they were prone to breakage in Pif1-deficient cells, whereas non-G4 Pif1-binding sites did not show this behavior. Introducing many copies of G4 motifs caused slow growth in replication-stressed Pif1-deficient cells, which was relieved by spontaneous mutations that eliminated their ability to form G4 structures, bind Pif1, slow DNA replication, and stimulate DNA breakage. These data suggest that G4 structures form in vivo and that they are resolved by Pif1 to prevent replication fork stalling and DNA breakage. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

The therapeutic effect is a consequence of nucleolar disruption and activation of p53-dependent apoptotic signaling. Human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines also show high sensitivity to inhibition of rDNA transcription that is dependent on p53 mutational status.

abstract = {Nearly four generations of investigators have studied combined drug effects. Their methods of generating and analyzing data have changed dramatically over the years but the basic problem has not. This review examines the inherent difficulties in analyzing combined drug effects and evaluates modem methods of describing these interactions. Researchers have traditionally used two-dimensional (2-D) methods to approximate the actual three-dimensional (3-D) nature of drug interactions. We conclude that these 2-D methods are often inadequate when used to analyze synergistic and antagonistic drug interactions in antiviral and anticancer chemotherapy. We propose a direct and pragmatic 3-D approach to the problem, made possible by microcomputers and sophisticated graphics programs. This procedure directly elucidates the shape of the dose-response surface, identifies the regions of statistically significant synergy and antagonism, and quantitates these effects. It also greatly simplifies the problem since a 3-D surface presents complete drug interactions in a way that can be easily interpreted. We will show that understanding the shape of the resulting 3-D surface is essential to an understanding of complex drug interactions. This new method facilitates the rigorous analysis of drug-drug interactions and offers investigators powerful new tools to analyze combinations of antiviral and anticancer drugs.},

Inhibition of Pol I by CX-5461 can selectively induce p53-mediated apoptosis of tumour cells in vivo. Currently, CX-5461 is in clinical trial for patients with advanced haematological malignancies (Peter Mac, Melbourne). Here we demonstrate that CX-5461 also induces p53-independent cell cycle checkpoints mediated by ATM/ATR signaling in the absence of DNA damage. Further, our data demonstrate that the combination of drugs targeting ATM/ATR signaling and CX-5461 leads to enhanced therapeutic benefit in treating p53-null tumours in vivo, which are normally refractory to each drug alone. Mechanistically, we show that CX-5461 induces an unusual chromatin structure in which transcriptionally competent relaxed rDNA repeats are devoid of transcribing Pol I leading to activation of ATM signaling within the nucleoli. Thus, we propose that acute inhibition of Pol transcription initiation by CX-5461 induces a novel nucleolar stress response that can be targeted to improve therapeutic efficacy.},

As one of the most energy consuming cellular processes, it is highly regulated by signaling pathways in response to changing cellular conditions. Many of the regulators of this process are aberrantly activated in various cancers. Recently two novel rRNA synthesis inhibitors, CX-5461 and BMH-21, have been shown to selectively kill cancer cells while sparing normal cells. Here, we tested the effectiveness of pre-rRNA synthesis inhibitor CX-5461 on acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells with different cytogenetic abnormalities. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells are more sensitive to rRNA synthesis inhibition compared to normal bone marrow cells. CX-5461 treated cells undergo caspase-dependent apoptosis independent of their p53 status. More-over, CX5461, activates checkpoint kinases and arrests cells in G2 phase of cell cycle. Finally, overcoming this G2 arrest by inhibiting ATR kinase leads to robust cell killing. These results show that CX-5461 can be even more potent in combination with ATR inhibitors.},

Here we implemented a computational tool to scan the presence of putative G-quadruplex forming sequences in the genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and analyse their association to transcription start sites. We found that the most stable G-quadruplexes were in the promoter region of genes belonging to definite functional categories. Actual G-quadruplex folding of four selected sequences was assessed by biophysical and biomolecular techniques: all molecules formed stable G-quadruplexes, which were further stabilized by two G-quadruplex ligands. These compounds inhibited Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth with minimal inhibitory concentrations in the low micromolar range. These data support formation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis G-quadruplexes in vivo and their potential regulation of gene transcription, and prompt the use of G4 ligands to develop original antitubercular agents.},

abstract = {Proper cell models for breast cancer primary tumors have long been the focal point in the cancer's research. The genomic comparison between cell lines and tumors can investigate the similarity and dissimilarity and help to select right cell model to mimic tumor tissues to properly evaluate the drug reaction in vitro. In this paper, a comprehensive comparison in copy number variation (CNV), mutation, mRNA expression and protein expression between 68 breast cancer cell lines and 1375 primary breast tumors is conducted and presented. Using whole genome expression arrays, strong correlations were observed between cells and tumors. PAM50 gene expression differentiated them into four major breast cancer subtypes: Luminal A and B, HER2amp, and Basal-like in both cells and tumors partially. Genomic CNVs patterns were observed between tumors and cells across chromosomes in general. High C {\textgreater} T and C {\textgreater} G trans-version rates were observed in both cells and tumors, while the cells had slightly higher somatic mutation rates than tumors. Clustering analysis on protein expression data can reasonably recover the breast cancer subtypes in cell lines and tumors. Although the drug-targeted proteins ER/PR and interesting mTOR/GSK3/TS2/PDK1/ER{\_}P118 cluster had shown the consistent patterns between cells and tumor, low protein-based correlations were observed between cells and tumors. The expression consistency of mRNA verse protein between cell line and tumors reaches 0.7076. These important drug targets in breast cancer, ESR1, PGR, HER2, EGFR and AR have a high similarity in mRNA and protein variation in both tumors and cell lines. GATA3 and RP56KB1 are two promising drug targets for breast cancer. A total score developed from the four correlations among four molecular profiles suggests that cell lines, BT483, T47D and MDAMB453 have the highest similarity with tumors. The integrated data from across these multiple platforms demonstrates the existence of the similarity and dissimilarity of molecular features between breast cancer tumors and cell lines. The cell lines only mirror some but not all of the molecular properties of primary tumors. The study results add more evidence in selecting cell line models for breast cancer research.},

abstract = {Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, remains a partially curable disease. Genetic alterations affecting components of NF-kappaB signaling pathways occur frequently in DLBCL. Almost all activated B cell-like (ABC) DLBCL, which is the least curable group among the 3 major subtypes of this malignancy, and a substantial fraction of germinal center B cell-like (GCB) DLBCL exhibit constitutive NF-kappaB pathway activity. It has been demonstrated that ABC-DLBCL cells require such activity for proliferation and survival. Therefore, inhibition of NF-kappaB activation in DLBCL may provide an efficient and targeted therapy. In screening for small-molecule compounds that may inhibit NF-kappaB activation in DLBCL cells, we identified a compound, NSC697923, which inhibits the activity of the ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzyme Ubc13-Uev1A. NSC697923 impedes the formation of the Ubc13 and ubiquitin thioester conjugate and suppresses constitutive NF-kappaB activity in ABC-DLBCL cells. Importantly, NSC697923 inhibits the proliferation and survival of ABC-DLBCL cells and GCB-DLBCL cells, suggesting the Ubc13-Uev1A may be crucial for DLBCL growth. Consistently, knockdown of Ubc13 expression also inhibited DLBCL cell survival. The results of the present study indicate that Ubc13-Uev1A may represent a potential therapeutic target in DLBCL. In addition, compound NSC697923 may be exploited for the development of DLBCL therapeutic agents.},

abstract = {Glioma is a heterogeneous, invasive primary brain tumor with a wide range of patient survival and a lack of reliable prognostic biomarkers. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) has been reported in the presence of multiple transcripts in various tumor systems. The biological function and precise regulatory mechanisms of hTERT transcripts remain uncertain. Alternative splicing of hTERT and telomerase activity were examined in 96 glioma specimens, including 38 glioblastomas (GBMs), 23 oligodendrogliomas (ODMs), and 35 oligoastrocytomas (OAMs). The correlation between telomerase activity or hTERT transcripts and patient clinical characteristics was investigated. We examined the regulation of alternative splicing of hTERT and telomerase activity by G-quadruplex stabilizer CX-5461 in GBM cells. The biological effects of CX-5461 on GBM cell lines, including inhibition of cell proliferation, effects on cell cycle/apoptosis, and telomere DNA damage were further explored. The $\beta$ splicing was verified in human gliomas and hTERT+$\beta$ was significantly correlated with higher telomerase activity, higher KPS, larger tumor size, and higher tumor grades. Meanwhile, glioma patients lacking hTERT+$\beta$ expression or telomerase activity showed a significant survival benefit. Notably, CX-5461 altered hTERT splicing patterns, leading to an increase of hTERT-$\beta$ transcript and a decrease of hTERT+$\beta$ transcript expression, which inhibits telomerase activity. In addition, CX-5461 had cytotoxic effects on GBM cells and caused telomere DNA damage response, induced G2/M arrest and apoptosis. The hTERT+$\beta$ is verified to be correlated with clinical parameters in gliomas, and could serve as a prognostic marker or possibly therapeutic target for gliomas. CX-5461 can regulate the splicing pattern of hTERT, inhibit telomerase activity, and kill GBM cells.},

The therapeutic activity comes at a cost of normal tissue toxicity and genotoxicity. We have recently described a planar heterocyclic small molecule DNA intercalator, BMH-21, that binds ribosomal DNA and inhibits RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription. Despite DNA intercalation, BMH-21 does not cause phosphorylation of H2AX, a key biomarker activated in DNA damage stress. Here we assessed whether BMH-21 activity towards expression and localization of Pol I marker proteins depends on DNA damage signaling and repair pathways. We show that BMH-21 effects on the nucleolar stress response were independent of major DNA damage associated PI3-kinase pathways, ATM, ATR and DNA-PK cs . However, testing a series of BMH-21 derivatives with alterations in its  N,N -dimethylaminocarboxamide arm showed that several derivatives had acquired the property to activate ATM- and DNA-PK cs  -dependent damage sensing and repair pathways while their ability to cause nucleolar stress and affect cell viability was greatly reduced. The data show that BMH-21 is a chemically unique DNA intercalator that has high bioactivity towards Pol I inhibition without activation or dependence of DNA damage stress. The findings also show that interference with DNA and DNA metabolic processes can be exploited therapeutically without causing DNA damage.},

abstract = {Most eukaryotic telomeres contain a repeating motif with stretches of guanine residues that form a 3'-terminal overhang extending beyond the telomeric duplex region. The telomeric repeat of hypotrichous ciliates, d(T(4)G(4)), forms a 16-nucleotide 3'-overhang. Such sequences can adopt parallel-stranded as well as antiparallel-stranded quadruplex conformations in vitro. Although it has been proposed that guanine-quadruplex conformations may have important cellular roles including telomere function, recombination, and transcription, evidence for the existence of this DNA structure in vivo has been elusive to date. We have generated high-affinity single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) probes for the guanine-quadruplex formed by the Stylonychia telomeric repeat, by ribosome display from the Human Combinatorial Antibody Library. Of the scFvs selected, one (Sty3) had an affinity of K(d) = 125 pM for the parallel-stranded guanine-quadruplex and could discriminate with at least 1,000-fold specificity between parallel or antiparallel quadruplex conformations formed by the same sequence motif. A second scFv (Sty49) bound both the parallel and antiparallel quadruplex with similar (K(d) = 3--5 nM) affinity. Indirect immunofluorescence studies show that Sty49 reacts specifically with the macronucleus but not the micronucleus of Stylonychia lemnae. The replication band, the region where replication and telomere elongation take place, was also not stained, suggesting that the guanine-quadruplex is resolved during replication. Our results provide experimental evidence that the telomeres of Stylonychia macronuclei adopt in vivo a guanine-quadruplex structure, indicating that this structure may have an important role for telomere functioning.},

abstract = {Mutations in BLM in Bloom Syndrome patients predispose them to multiple types of cancers. Here we report that BLM is recruited in a biphasic manner to annotated DSBs. BLM recruitment is dependent on the presence of NBS1, MRE11 and ATM. While ATM activity is essential for BLM recruitment in early phase, it is dispensable in late phase when MRE11 exonuclease activity and RNF8-mediated ubiquitylation of BLM are the key determinants. Interaction between polyubiquitylated BLM and NBS1 is essential for the helicase to be retained at the DSBs. The helicase activity of BLM is required for the recruitment of HR and c-NHEJ factors onto the chromatin in S- and G1-phase, respectively. During the repair phase, BLM inhibits HR in S-phase and c-NHEJ in G1-phase. Consequently, inhibition of helicase activity of BLM enhances the rate of DNA alterations. Thus BLM utilizes its pro- and anti-repair functions to maintain genome stability.},

RNA polymerase (Pol) I, the multiprotein complex that synthesizes rRNA, is activated widely in cancer. Thus, selective inhibitors of Pol I may offer a general therapeutic strategy to block cancer cell proliferation. Coupling medicinal chemistry efforts to tandem cell- and molecular-based screening led to the design of CX-5461, a potent small-molecule inhibitor of rRNA synthesis in cancer cells. CX-5461 selectively inhibits Pol I-driven transcription relative to Pol II-driven transcription, DNA replication, and protein translation. Molecular studies demonstrate that CX-5461 inhibits the initiation stage of rRNA synthesis and induces both senescence and autophagy, but not apoptosis, through a p53-independent process in solid tumor cell lines. CX-5461 is orally bioavailable and demonstrates in vivo antitumor activity against human solid tumors in murine xenograft models. Our findings position CX-5461 for investigational clinical trials as a potent, selective, and orally administered agent for cancer treatment.},

Here, we defined the activated RNF8-Ubc13∼ubiquitin complex by x-ray crystallography and its functional solution conformations by x-ray scattering, as tested by separation-of-function mutations imaged in cells by immunofluorescence. The collective results show that the RING E3 RNF8 targets E2 Ubc13 to DSB sites and plays a critical role in damage signaling by stimulating polyubiquitination through modulating conformations of ubiquitin covalently linked to the Ubc13 active site. Structure-guided separation-of-function mutations show that the RNF8 E2 stimulating activity is essential for DSB signaling in mammalian cells and is necessary for downstream recruitment of 53BP1 and BRCA1. Chromatin-targeted RNF168 rescues 53BP1 recruitment involved in non-homologous end joining but not BRCA1 recruitment for homologous recombination. These findings suggest an allosteric approach to targeting the ubiquitin-docking cleft at the E2-E3 interface for possible interventions in cancer and chronic inflammation, and moreover, they establish an independent RNF8 role in BRCA1 recruitment.},

abstract = {G-quadruplex (G4)-forming genomic sequences, including telomeres, represent natural replication fork barriers. Stalled replication forks can be stabilized and restarted by homologous recombination (HR), which also repairs DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) arising at collapsed forks. We have previously shown that HR facilitates telomere replication. Here, we demonstrate that the replication efficiency of guanine-rich (G-rich) telomeric repeats is decreased significantly in cells lacking HR. Treatment with the G4-stabilizing compound pyridostatin (PDS) increases telomere fragility in BRCA2-deficient cells, suggesting that G4 formation drives telomere instability. Remarkably, PDS reduces proliferation of HR-defective cells by inducing DSB accumulation, checkpoint activation, and deregulated G2/M progression and by enhancing the replication defect intrinsic to HR deficiency. PDS toxicity extends to HR-defective cells that have acquired olaparib resistance through loss of 53BP1 or REV7. Altogether, these results highlight the therapeutic potential of G4-stabilizing drugs to selectively eliminate HR-compromised cells and tumors, including those resistant to PARP inhibition.},

The software can also be embedded into any tool that performs gene list analysis. We applied Enrichr to analyze nine cancer cell lines by comparing their enrichment signatures to the enrichment signatures of matched normal tissues. We observed a common pattern of up regulation of the polycomb group PRC2 and enrichment for the histone mark H3K27me3 in many cancer cell lines, as well as alterations in Toll-like receptor and interlukin signaling in K562 cells when compared with normal myeloid CD33+ cells.

Individuals bearing inactivating mutations in components of this response exhibit clinical symptoms that include cellular radiosensitivity, immunodeficiency, and cancer predisposition. The archetype for such disorders is Ataxia-Telangiectasia caused by biallelic mutation in ATM, a central component of the DNA damage response. Here, we report that the ubiquitin ligase RNF168 is mutated in the RIDDLE syndrome, a recently discovered immunodeficiency and radiosensitivity disorder. We show that RNF168 is recruited to sites of DNA damage by binding to ubiquitylated histone H2A. RNF168 acts with UBC13 to amplify the RNF8-dependent histone ubiquitylation by targeting H2A-type histones and by promoting the formation of lysine 63-linked ubiquitin conjugates. These RNF168-dependent chromatin modifications orchestrate the accumulation of 53BP1 and BRCA1 to DNA lesions, and their loss is the likely cause of the cellular and developmental phenotypes associated with RIDDLE syndrome. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {G-quadruplexes (G4s) are noncanonical nucleic acid secondary structures formed by guanine-rich DNA and RNA sequences. In this review we aim to provide an overview of the biological roles of G4s in microbial genomes with emphasis on recent discoveries. G4s are enriched and conserved in the regulatory regions of microbes, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Importantly, G4s in hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) genomes modulate genes crucial for virus replication. Recent studies on Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) shed light on the role of G4s within the microbial transcripts as cis-acting regulatory signals that modulate translation and facilitate immune evasion. Furthermore, G4s in microbial genomes have been linked to radioresistance, antigenic variation, recombination, and latency. G4s in microbial genomes represent novel therapeutic targets for antimicrobial therapy.},

abstract = {Limiting the levels of homologous recombination (HR) that occur at sites of DNA damage is a major role of BLM helicase. However, very little is known about the mechanisms dictating its relocalization to these sites. Here, we demonstrate that the ubiquitin/SUMO‐dependent DNA damage response (UbS‐DDR), controlled by the E3 ligases RNF8/RNF168, triggers BLM recruitment to sites of replication fork stalling via ubiquitylation in the N‐terminal region of BLM and subsequent BLM binding to the ubiquitin‐interacting motifs of RAP80. Furthermore, we show that this mechanism of BLM relocalization is essential for BLM's ability to suppress excessive/uncontrolled HR at stalled replication forks. Unexpectedly, we also uncovered a requirement for RNF8‐dependent ubiquitylation of BLM and PML for maintaining the integrity of PML‐associated nuclear bodies and as a consequence the localization of BLM to these structures. Lastly, we identified a novel role for RAP80 in preventing proteasomal degradation of BLM in unstressed cells. Taken together, these data highlight an important biochemical link between the UbS‐DDR and BLM‐dependent pathways involved in maintaining genome stability.},

abstract = {Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections cause congenital birth defects and disease in immunosuppressed individuals. Antiviral compounds can control infection yet their use is restricted due to concerns of toxicity and the emergence of drug resistant strains. We have evaluated the impact of an RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) inhibitor, CX-5461 on HCMV replication. CX-5461 inhibits Pol I-mediated ribosomal DNA transcription by binding G-quadruplex DNA structures and also activates cellular stress response pathways. The addition of CX-5461 at both early and late stages of the HCMV infection inhibited viral DNA synthesis and virus production. Interestingly, adding CX-5461 after the onset of viral DNA synthesis resulted in a greater reduction compared to continuous treatment starting early during infection. We observed an accompanying increase in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 in infected cells treated late but not early which likely explains the differences. Our previous studies demonstrated the importance of p21 in the antiviral activity of the HCMV kinase inhibitor, maribavir. Addition of CX-5461 increased the anti-HCMV activity of maribavir. Our data demonstrate that CX-5461 inhibits HCMV replication and synergizes with maribavir to disrupt infection.},

@article{Sarkies2012,
abstract = {We have previously reported that DT40 cells deficient in the Y-family polymerase REV1 are defective in replicating G-quadruplex DNA. In vivo this leads to uncoupling of DNA synthesis from redeposition of histones displaced ahead of the replication fork, which in turn leads to loss of transcriptional repression due to failure to recycle pre-existing repressive histone post-translational modifications. Here we report that a similar process can also affect transcriptionally active genes, leading to their deactivation. We use this finding to develop an assay based on loss of expression of a cell surface marker to monitor epigenetic instability at the level of single cells. This assay allows us to demonstrate G4 DNA motif-associated epigenetic instability in mutants of three helicases previously implicated in the unwinding of G-quadruplex structures, FANCJ, WRN and BLM. Transcriptional profiling of DT40 mutants reveals that FANCJ coordinates two independent mechanisms to maintain epigenetic stability near G4 DNA motifs that are dependent on either REV1 or on the WRN and BLM helicases, suggesting a model in which efficient in vivo replication of G-quadruplexes often requires the established 5′–3′-helicase activity of FANCJ acting in concert with either a specialized polymerase or helicase operating in the opposite polarity.},

abstract = {Ubiquitination of histones plays a critical role in the regulation of several processes within the nucleus, including maintenance of genome stability and transcriptional regulation. The only known ubiquitination site on histones is represented by a conserved Lys residue located at the C terminus of the protein. Here, we describe a novel ubiquitin mark at the N-terminal tail of histone H2As consisting of two Lys residues at positions 13 and 15 (K13/K15). This "bidentate" site is a target of the DNA damage response (DDR) ubiquitin ligases RNF8 and RNF168. Histone mutants lacking the K13/K15 site impair RNF168- and DNA damage-dependent ubiquitination. Conversely, inactivation of the canonical C-terminal site prevents the constitutive monoubiquitination of histone H2As but does not abolish the ubiquitination induced by RNF168. A ubiquitination-defective mutant is obtained by inactivating both the N- and the C-terminal sites, suggesting that these are unique, non-redundant acceptors of ubiquitination on histone H2As. This unprecedented result implies that RNF168 generates a qualitatively different Ub mark on chromatin.},

@article{Cogoi2006,
abstract = {In human and mouse, the promoter of the KRAS gene contains a nuclease hypersensitive polypurine-polypyrimidine element (NHPPE) that is essential for transcription. An interesting feature of the polypurine G-rich strand of NHPPE is its ability to assume an unusual DNA structure that, according to circular dichroism (CD) and DMS footprinting experiments, is attributed to an intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex, consisting of three G-tetrads and three loops. The human and mouse KRAS NHPPE G-rich strands display melting temperature of 64 and 73 degrees C, respectively, as well as a K+-dependent capacity to arrest DNA polymerase. Photocleavage and CD experiments showed that the cationic porphyrin TMPyP4 stacks to the external G-tetrads of the KRAS quadruplexes, increasing the T(m) by approximately 20 degrees C. These findings raise the intriguing question that the G-quadruplex formed within the NHPPE of KRAS may be involved in the regulation of transcription. Indeed, transfection experiments showed that the activity of the mouse KRAS promoter is reduced to 20{\%} of control, in the presence of the quadruplex-stabilizing TMPyP4. In addition, we found that G-rich oligonucleotides mimicking the KRAS quadruplex, but not the corresponding 4-base mutant sequences or oligonucleotides forming quadruplexes with different structures, competed with the NHPPE duplex for binding to nuclear proteins. When vector pKRS-413, containing CAT driven by the mouse KRAS promoter, and KRAS quadruplex oligonucleotides were co-transfected in 293 cells, the expression of CAT was found to be downregulated to 40{\%} of the control. On the basis of these data, we propose that the NHPPE of KRAS exists in equilibrium between a double-stranded form favouring transcription and a folded quadruplex form, which instead inhibits transcription. Such a mechanism, which is probably adopted by other growth-related genes, provides useful hints for the rational design of anticancer drugs against the KRAS oncogene.},

abstract = {Although well studied in vitro, the in vivo functions of G-quadruplexes (G4-DNA and G4-RNA) are only beginning to be defined. Recent studies have demonstrated enrichment for sequences with intramolecular G-quadruplex forming potential (QFP) in transcriptional promoters of humans, chickens and bacteria. Here we survey the yeast genome for QFP sequences and similarly find strong enrichment for these sequences in upstream promoter regions, as well as weaker but significant enrichment in open reading frames (ORFs). Further, four findings are consistent with roles for QFP sequences in transcriptional regulation. First, QFP is correlated with upstream promoter regions with low histone occupancy. Second, treatment of cells with N-methyl mesoporphyrin IX (NMM), which binds G-quadruplexes selectively in vitro, causes significant upregulation of loci with QFP-possessing promoters or ORFs. NMM also causes downregulation of loci connected with the function of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA), which itself has high QFP. Third, ORFs with QFP are selectively downregulated in sgs1 mutants that lack the G4-DNA-unwinding helicase Sgs1p. Fourth, a screen for yeast mutants that enhance or suppress growth inhibition by NMM revealed enrichment for chromatin and transcriptional regulators, as well as telomere maintenance factors. These findings raise the possibility that QFP sequences form bona fide G-quadruplexes in vivo and thus regulate transcription.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The intractability of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is exacerbated by tumour heterogeneity, including diverse alterations to the androgen receptor (AR) axis and AR-independent phenotypes. The availability of additional models encompassing this heterogeneity would facilitate the identification of more effective therapies for CRPC. OBJECTIVE To discover therapeutic strategies by exploiting patient-derived models that exemplify the heterogeneity of CRPC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Four new patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) were established from independent metastases of two patients and characterised using integrative genomics. A panel of rationally selected drugs was tested using an innovative ex vivo PDX culture system. INTERVENTION The following drugs were evaluated: AR signalling inhibitors (enzalutamide and galeterone), a PARP inhibitor (talazoparib), a chemotherapeutic (cisplatin), a CDK4/6 inhibitor (ribociclib), bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) protein inhibitors (iBET151 and JQ1), and inhibitors of ribosome biogenesis/function (RNA polymerase I inhibitor CX-5461 and pan-PIM kinase inhibitor CX-6258). OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Drug efficacy in ex vivo cultures of PDX tissues was evaluated using immunohistochemistry for Ki67 and cleaved caspase-3 levels. Candidate drugs were also tested for antitumour efficacy in vivo, with tumour volume being the primary endpoint. Two-tailed t tests were used to compare drug and control treatments. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Integrative genomics revealed that the new PDXs exhibited heterogeneous mechanisms of resistance, including known and novel AR mutations, genomic structural rearrangements of the AR gene, and a neuroendocrine-like AR-null phenotype. Despite their heterogeneity, all models were sensitive to the combination of ribosome-targeting agents CX-5461 and CX-6258. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that ribosome-targeting drugs may be effective against diverse CRPC subtypes including AR-null disease, and highlights the potential of contemporary patient-derived models to prioritise treatment strategies for clinical translation. PATIENT SUMMARY Diverse types of therapy-resistant prostate cancers are sensitive to a new combination of drugs that inhibit protein synthesis pathways in cancer cells.},

abstract = {The G-overhangs of telomeres are thought to adopt particular conformations, such as T-loops or G-quadruplexes. It has been suggested that G-quadruplex structures could be stabilized by specific ligands in a new approach to cancer treatment consisting in inhibition of telomerase, an enzyme involved in telomere maintenance and cell immortality. Although the formation of G-quadruplexes was demonstrated in vitro many years ago, it has not been definitively demonstrated in living human cells. We therefore investigated the chromosomal binding of a tritiated G-quadruplex ligand, 3H-360A (2,6-N,N'-methyl-quinolinio-3-yl)-pyridine dicarboxamide [methyl-3H]. We verified the in vitro selectivity of 3H-360A for G-quadruplex structures by equilibrium dialysis. We then showed by binding experiments with human genomic DNA that 3H-360A has a very potent selectivity toward G-quadruplex structures of the telomeric 3'-overhang. Finally, we performed autoradiography of metaphase spreads from cells cultured with 3H-360A. We found that 3H-360A was preferentially bound to chromosome terminal regions of both human normal (peripheral blood lymphocytes) and tumor cells (T98G and CEM1301). In conclusion, our results provide evidence that a specific G-quadruplex ligand interacts with the terminal ends of human chromosomes. They support the hypothesis that G-quadruplex ligands induce and/or stabilize G-quadruplex structures at telomeres of human cells.},

abstract = {BRCA1 and BRCA2 are often mutated in familial breast and ovarian cancer. Both tumor suppressors play key roles in the DNA-damage response [1, 2]. However, it remains unclear whether these two tumor suppressor function together in the same DNA-damage response pathway. Here, we show that BRCA1 associates with BRCA2 through PALB2/FANCN, a major binding partner of BRCA2 [3]. The interaction between BRCA1 and BRCA2 is abrogated in PALB2-deficient Fanconi anemia cells and in the cells depleted of PALB2 by small interfering RNA. Moreover, we show that BRCA1 promotes the concentration of PALB2 and BRCA2 at DNA-damage sites and the interaction between BRCA1 and PALB2 is important for the homologous recombination repair. Taken together, our results indicate that BRCA1 is an upstream regulator of BRCA2 in the DNA-damage response, and PALB2 is the linker between BRCA1 and BRCA2. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

G4 formation can affect chromatin architecture and gene regulation and has been associated with genomic instability, genetic diseases and cancer progression. Here we present a high-resolution sequencing-based method to detect G4s in the human genome. We identified 716,310 distinct G4 structures, 451,646 of which were not predicted by computational methods. These included previously uncharacterized noncanonical long loop and bulged structures. We observed a high G4 density in functional regions, such as 5' untranslated regions and splicing sites, as well as in genes previously not predicted to contain these structures (such as BRCA2). G4 formation was significantly associated with oncogenes, tumor suppressors and somatic copy number alterations related to cancer development. The G4s identified in this study may therefore represent promising targets for cancer intervention.},

Recent genome sequencing studies in cancers have revealed mutations in ATRX and their association with ALT (alternative lengthening of telomeres) activation. Here we report depletion of ATRX in mouse ES cells leads to selective loss in ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) copy number. Supporting this, ATRX-mutated human ALT-positive tumors also show a substantially lower rDNA copy than ALT-negative tumors. Further investigation shows that the rDNA copy loss and repeat instability are caused by a disruption in H3.3 deposition and thus a failure in heterochromatin formation at rDNA repeats in the absence of ATRX. We also find that ATRX-depleted cells are reduced in ribosomal RNA transcription output and show increased sensitivity to RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription inhibitor CX5461. In addition, human ALT-positive cancer cell lines are also more sensitive to CX5461 treatment. Our study provides insights into the contribution of ATRX loss of function to tumorigenesis through the loss of rDNA stability and suggests the therapeutic potential of targeting Pol I transcription in ALT cancers.},

abstract = {Purpose: A hallmark of neoplasia is increased ribosome biogenesis, and targeting this process with RNA polymerase I (Pol I) inhibitors has shown some efficacy. We examined the contribution and potential targeting of ribosomal machinery in chemotherapy-resistant and -sensitive models of ovarian cancer.

Experimental Design: Pol I machinery expression was examined, and subsequently targeted with the Pol I inhibitor CX-5461, in ovarian cancer cell lines, an immortalized surface epithelial line, and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models with and without chemotherapy. Effects on viability, Pol I occupancy of rDNA, ribosomal content, and chemosensitivity were examined.

Results: In PDX models, ribosomal machinery components were increased in chemotherapy-treated tumors compared with controls. Thirteen cell lines were sensitive to CX-5461, with IC50s 25 nmol/L–2 $\mu$mol/L. Interestingly, two chemoresistant lines were 10.5- and 5.5-fold more sensitive than parental lines. CX-5461 induced DNA damage checkpoint activation and G2–M arrest with increased $\gamma$H2AX staining. Chemoresistant cells had 2- to 4-fold increased rDNA Pol I occupancy and increased rRNA synthesis, despite having slower proliferation rates, whereas ribosome abundance and translational efficiency were not impaired. In five PDX models treated with CX-5461, one showed a complete response, one a 55{\%} reduction in tumor volume, and one maintained stable disease for 45 days.

Conclusions: Pol I inhibition with CX-5461 shows high activity in ovarian cancer cell lines and PDX models, with an enhanced effect on chemoresistant cells. Effects occur independent of proliferation rates or dormancy. This represents a novel therapeutic approach that may have preferential activity in chemoresistant populations.

abstract = {The bacterial clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system for genome editing has greatly expanded the toolbox for mammalian genetics, enabling the rapid generation of isogenic cell lines and mice with modified alleles. Here, we describe a pooled, loss-of-function genetic screening approach suitable for both positive and negative selection that uses a genome-scale lentiviral single-guide RNA (sgRNA) library. sgRNA expression cassettes were stably integrated into the genome, which enabled a complex mutant pool to be tracked by massively parallel sequencing. We used a library containing 73,000 sgRNAs to generate knockout collections and performed screens in two human cell lines. A screen for resistance to the nucleotide analog 6-thioguanine identified all expected members of the DNA mismatch repair pathway, whereas another for the DNA topoisomerase II (TOP2A) poison etoposide identified TOP2A, as expected, and also cyclin-dependent kinase 6, CDK6. A negative selection screen for essential genes identified numerous gene sets corresponding to fundamental processes. Last, we show that sgRNA efficiency is associated with specific sequence motifs, enabling the prediction of more effective sgRNAs. Collectively, these results establish Cas9/sgRNA screens as a powerful tool for systematic genetic analysis in mammalian cells.},

abstract = {In cells infected with herpes simplex virus type 1, intracellular dNTP pools increased markedly. Treatment of these cells with 3 $\mu$M acyclovir resulted in an additional expansion in pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools with dTTP increasing 32-fold and dCTP 8-fold. Both thymidine and deoxycytidine, however, compete with acyclovir for phosphorylation by the viral pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside kinase and thus reduce the amount of drug that is anabolized to the active form. Theoretically, agents which inhibit thymidylate synthase or dihydrofolate reductase should reduce intracellular pools of thymidine, resulting in the potentiation of the antiviral effects of acyclovir. We explored this strategy by quantitating the synergy produced by combinations of acyclovir and other drugs using three-dimensional dose-response surface methodology (MacSynergy™II). Significant synergy was seen with both 5-FdUrd and methotrexate whereas BrVdUrd, 5-CldUrd, 5-IdUrd, and 5-BrdUrd exhibited little to no synergistic activity. It is suggested that inhibitors of thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase warrant further exploration as potentiators of acyclovir. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

Recent studies have suggested Ubc13 as a potential therapeutic target for intervention in various human diseases including several different cancers, alleviation of anti-cancer drug resistance, chronic inflammation, and viral infections. Understanding a potential therapeutic target from different angles is important to assess its usefulness and potential pitfalls. Here we present a global review of Ubc13 from its structure, function, and cellular activities, to its natural and chemical inhibition. The aim of this article is to review the literature that directly implicates Ubc13 in a biological function, and to integrate structural and mechanistic insights into the larger role of this critical E2 enzyme. We discuss observations of multiple Ubc13 structures that suggest a novel mechanism for activation of Ubc13 that involves conformational change of the active site loop.},

abstract = {The replicative DNA polymerases are generally blocked by template DNA damage. The resulting replication arrest can be released by one of two post-replication repair (PRR) pathways, translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) and template switching by homologous recombination (HR). The HERC2 ubiquitin ligase plays a role in homologous recombination by facilitating the assembly of the Ubc13 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme with the RNF8 ubiquitin ligase. To explore the role of HERC2 and RNF8 in PRR, we examined immunoglobulin diversification in chicken DT40 cells deficient in HERC2 and RNF8. Unexpectedly, the HERC2−/− and RNF8−/− cells and HERC2−/−/RNF8−/− double mutant cells exhibit a significant reduction in the rate of immunoglobulin (Ig) hypermutation, compared to wild-type cells. Further, the HERC2−/− and RNF8−/− mutants exhibit defective maintenance of replication fork progression immediately after exposure to UV while retaining proficient post-replicative gap filling. These mutants are both proficient in mono-ubiquitination of PCNA. Taken together, these results suggest that HERC2 and RNF8 promote TLS past abasic sites and UV-lesions at or very close to stalled replication forks.},

Recently, two new rRNA synthesis inhibitors have demonstrated therapeutic effects on cancer cells while sparing normal cells. One of them, CX-5461, is currently in phase 1 clinical trials for hematological malignancies. Here, we investigate the effectiveness of transient treatment with this drug on acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Our results show that short exposure to CX-5461 followed by drug washout is sufficient to induce persistent G2 cell-cycle arrest and irreversible commitment to cell death, in spite of rRNA synthesis returning to normal within 24 hours of drug washout. The magnitude of cell death after transient exposure is similar to continuous exposure, but the time to cell death is relatively delayed with transient exposure. In this report, we also investigate rational drug combinations that can potentiate the effect of continuous CX-5461 treatment. We show that the checkpoint abrogator UCN-01 can relieve CX-5461-induced G2 arrest and potentiate the cytotoxic effects of CX-5461. Finally, we show that ERK1/2 is activated upon CX-5461 treatment, and that pharmacological inhibition of MEK1/2 leads to enhanced cell death in combination with CX-5461. In summary, our results provide evidence for the effectiveness of CX-5461 pulse treatment, which may minimize drug related toxicity, and evidence for enhanced effectiveness of CX-5461 in combination with other targeted agents.},

abstract = {During DNA damage response, the RING E3 ligase RNF168 ubiquitinates nucleosomal H2A at K13-15. Here we show that the ubiquitination reaction is regulated by its substrate. We define a region on the RING domain important for target recognition and identify the H2A/H2B dimer as the minimal substrate to confer lysine specificity to the RNF168 reaction. Importantly, we find an active role for the substrate in the reaction. H2A/H2B dimers and nucleosomes enhance the E3-mediated discharge of ubiquitin from the E2 and redirect the reaction towards the relevant target, in a process that depends on an intact acidic patch. This active contribution of a region distal from the target lysine provides regulation of the specific K13-15 ubiquitination reaction during the complex signalling process at DNA damage sites.},

abstract = {Five molecular subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, basal-like, and claudin-low) with clinical implications exist in breast cancer. Here, we evaluated the molecular and phenotypic relationships of (1) a large in vitro panel of human breast cancer cell lines (BCCLs), human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs), and human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs); (2) in vivo breast tumors; (3) normal breast cell subpopulations; (4) human embryonic stem cells (hESCs); and (5) bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC). First, by integrating genomic data of 337 breast tumor samples with 93 cell lines we were able to identify all the intrinsic tumor subtypes in the cell lines, except for luminal A. Secondly, we observed that the cell lines recapitulate the differentiation hierarchy detected in the normal mammary gland, with claudin-low BCCLs and HMFs cells showing a stromal phenotype, HMECs showing a mammary stem cell/bipotent progenitor phenotype, basal-like cells showing a luminal progenitor phenotype, and luminal B cell lines showing a mature luminal phenotype. Thirdly, we identified basal-like and highly migratory claudin-low subpopulations of cells within a subset of triple-negative BCCLs (SUM149PT, HCC1143, and HCC38). Interestingly, both subpopulations within SUM149PT were enriched for tumor-initiating cells, but the basal-like subpopulation grew tumors faster than the claudin-low subpopulation. Finally, claudin-low BCCLs resembled the phenotype of hMSCs, whereas hESCs cells showed an epithelial phenotype without basal or luminal differentiation. The results presented here help to improve our understanding of the wide range of breast cancer cell line models through the appropriate pairing of cell lines with relevant in vivo tumor and normal cell counterparts.},

@article{Gerhards2018,
abstract = {Despite substantial advances in the treatment of various cancers, many patients still receive anti-cancer therapies that hardly eradicate tumor cells but inflict considerable side effects. To provide the best treatment regimen for an individual patient, a major goal in molecular oncology is to identify predictive markers for a personalized therapeutic strategy. Regarding novel targeted anti-cancer therapies, there are usually good markers available. Unfortunately, however, targeted therapies alone often result in rather short remissions and little cytotoxic effect on the cancer cells. Therefore, classical chemotherapy with frequent long remissions, cures, and a clear effect on cancer cell eradication remains a corner stone in current anti-cancer therapy. Reliable biomarkers which predict the response of tumors to classical chemotherapy are rare, in contrast to the situation for targeted therapy. For the bulk of cytotoxic therapeutic agents, including DNA-damaging drugs, drugs targeting microtubules or antimetabolites, there are still no reliable biomarkers used in the clinic to predict tumor response. To make progress in this direction, meticulous studies of classical chemotherapeutic drug action and resistance mechanisms are required. For this purpose, novel functional screening technologies have emerged as successful technologies to study chemotherapeutic drug response in a variety of models. They allow a systematic analysis of genetic contributions to a drug-responsive or −sensitive phenotype and facilitate a better understanding of the mode of action of these drugs. These functional genomic approaches are not only useful for the development of novel targeted anti-cancer drugs but may also guide the use of classical chemotherapeutic drugs by deciphering novel mechanisms influencing a tumor's drug response. Moreover, due to the advances of 3D organoid cultures from patient tumors and in vivo screens in mice, these genetic screens can be applied using conditions that are more representative of the clinical setting. Patient-derived 3D organoid lines furthermore allow the characterization of the “essentialome”, the specific set of genes required for survival of these cells, of an individual tumor, which could be monitored over the course of treatment and help understanding how drug resistance evolves in clinical tumors. Thus, we expect that these functional screens will enable the discovery of novel cancer-specific vulnerabilities, and through clinical validation, move the field of predictive biomarkers forward. This review focuses on novel advanced techniques to decipher the interplay between genetic alterations and drug response.},

@article{Mailand2007,
abstract = {Accumulation of repair proteins on damaged chromosomes is required to restore genomic integrity. However, the mechanisms of protein retention at the most destructive chromosomal lesions, the DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), are poorly understood. We show that RNF8, a RING-finger ubiquitin ligase, rapidly assembles at DSBs via interaction of its FHA domain with the phosphorylated adaptor protein MDC1. This is accompanied by an increase in DSB-associated ubiquitylations and followed by accumulation of 53BP1 and BRCA1 repair proteins. Knockdown of RNF8 or disruption of its FHA or RING domains impaired DSB-associated ubiquitylation and inhibited retention of 53BP1 and BRCA1 at the DSB sites. In addition, we show that RNF8 can ubiquitylate histone H2A and H2AX, and that its depletion sensitizes cells to ionizing radiation. These data suggest that MDC1-mediated and RNF8-executed histone ubiquitylation protects genome integrity by licensing the DSB-flanking chromatin to concentrate repair factors near the DNA lesions. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {UBE2N is a K63-specific ubiquitin conjugase linked to various immune disorders and cancer. Here, we demonstrate that UBE2N and its partners UBE2V1 and UBE2V2 are highly expressed in malignant melanoma. Silencing of UBE2N and its partners significantly decreased melanoma cell proliferation and subcutaneous tumor growth. This was accompanied by increased expression of E-cadherin, p16, and MC1R and decreased expression of melanoma malignancy markers including SOX10, Nestin, and ABCB5. Mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic analysis revealed that UBE2N loss resulted in distinct alterations to the signaling landscape: MEK/ERK signaling was impaired, FRA1 and SOX10 gene regulators were downregulated, and p53 and p16 tumor suppressors were upregulated. Similar to inhibition of UBE2N and MEK, silencing FRA1 decreased SOX10 expression and cell proliferation. Conversely, exogenous expression of active FRA1 increased pMEK and SOX10 expression, and restored anchorage-independent cell growth of cells with UBE2N loss. Systemic delivery of NSC697923, a small-molecule inhibitor of UBE2N, significantly decreased melanoma xenograft growth. These data indicate that UBE2N is a novel regulator of the MEK/FRA1/SOX10 signaling cascade and is indispensable for malignant melanoma growth. Our findings establish the basis for targeting UBE2N as a potential treatment strategy for melanoma.Significance: These findings identify ubiquitin conjugase UBE2N and its variant partners as novel regulators of MAPK signaling and potential therapeutic targets in melanoma.

abstract = {The study of high-throughput genomic profiles from a pharmacogenomics viewpoint has provided unprecedented insights into the oncogenic features modulating drug response. A recent study screened for the response of a thousand human cancer cell lines to a wide collection of anti-cancer drugs and illuminated the link between cellular genotypes and vulnerability. However, due to essential differences between cell lines and tumors, to date the translation into predicting drug response in tumors remains challenging. Recently, advances in deep learning have revolutionized bioinformatics and introduced new techniques to the integration of genomic data. Its application on pharmacogenomics may fill the gap between genomics and drug response and improve the prediction of drug response in tumors. We proposed a deep learning model to predict drug response (DeepDR) based on mutation and expression profiles of a cancer cell or a tumor. The model contains three deep neural networks (DNNs), i) a mutation encoder pre-trained using a large pan-cancer dataset (The Cancer Genome Atlas; TCGA) to abstract core representations of high-dimension mutation data, ii) a pre-trained expression encoder, and iii) a drug response predictor network integrating the first two subnetworks. Given a pair of mutation and expression profiles, the model predicts IC50 values of 265 drugs. We trained and tested the model on a dataset of 622 cancer cell lines and achieved an overall prediction performance of mean squared error at 1.96 (log-scale IC50 values). The performance was superior in prediction error or stability than two classical methods (linear regression and support vector machine) and four analog DNN models of DeepDR, including DNNs built without TCGA pre-training, partly replaced by principal components, and built on individual types of input data. We then applied the model to predict drug response of 9059 tumors of 33 cancer types. Using per-cancer and pan-cancer settings, the model predicted both known, including EGFR inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer and tamoxifen in ER+ breast cancer, and novel drug targets, such as vinorelbine for TTN-mutated tumors. The comprehensive analysis further revealed the molecular mechanisms underlying the resistance to a chemotherapeutic drug docetaxel in a pan-cancer setting and the anti-cancer potential of a novel agent, CX-5461, in treating gliomas and hematopoietic malignancies. Here we present, as far as we know, the first DNN model to translate pharmacogenomics features identified from in vitro drug screening to predict the response of tumors. The results covered both well-studied and novel mechanisms of drug resistance and drug targets. Our model and findings improve the prediction of drug response and the identification of novel therapeutic options.},

abstract = {Mutations in breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 and 2 (BRCA1 and BRCA2) predispose individuals to breast and ovarian cancer development. We previously reported an in vivo interaction between BRCA1 and BRCA2. However, the biological significance of their association is thus far undefined. Here, we report that PALB2, the partner and localizer of BRCA2, binds directly to BRCA1, and serves as the molecular scaffold in the formation of the BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 complex. The association between BRCA1 and PALB2 is primarily mediated via apolar bonding between their respective coiled-coil domains. More importantly, BRCA1 mutations identified in cancer patients disrupted the specific interaction between BRCA1 and PALB2. Consistent with the converging functions of the BRCA proteins in DNA repair, cells harboring mutations with abrogated BRCA1-PALB2 interaction resulted in defective homologous recombination (HR) repair. We propose that, via its direct interaction with PALB2, BRCA1 fine-tunes recombinational repair partly through its modulatory role in the PALB2-dependent loading of BRCA2-RAD51 repair machinery at DNA breaks. Our findings uncover PALB2 as the molecular adaptor between the BRCA proteins, and suggest that impaired HR repair is one of the fundamental causes for genomic instability and tumorigenesis observed in patients carrying BRCA1, BRCA2, or PALB2 mutations.},
